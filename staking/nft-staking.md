# ðŸ”¹ NFT Staking

#### _NFT staking with Proton Protocol._

* _Proton Protocol is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform built on the blockchain that allows users to stake their Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) in return for rewards. NFTs are unique digital assets that are verified on the blockchain, and they can be used to represent a wide range of items, such as art, collectibles, and in-game items._
*   _When users stake their NFTs with Proton Protocol, they receive a proportional share of the platform's transaction fees. The amount of rewards users receive is based on the duration of their staking period, as well as the number and value of the NFTs they stake._

    _One benefit of NFT staking with Proton Protocol is that it provides users with a way to earn passive income on their NFT holdings. Instead of simply holding onto their NFTs, users can earn additional tokens by staking them on the Proton Protocol platform._
