# ðŸ”¹ NFT Staking

#### _NFT staking with Proton Protocol._

* _Proton Protocol is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform built on the blockchain that allows users to stake their Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) in return for rewards. NFTs are unique digital assets that are verified on the blockchain, and they can be used to represent a wide range of items, such as art, collectibles, and in-game items._
*   _When users stake their NFTs with Proton Protocol, they receive a proportional share of the platform's transaction fees. The amount of rewards users receive is based on the duration of their staking period, as well as the number and value of the NFTs they stake._

    _One benefit of NFT staking with Proton Protocol is that it provides users with a way to earn passive income on their NFT holdings. Instead of simply holding onto their NFTs, users can earn additional tokens by staking them on the Proton Protocol platform._

#### Proton Protocol NFTs and Special NFTs staking

* _When creating a staking vault with PROTON tokens, youâ€™ll be able to add APY booster NFTs such as the Special NFTs and Proton NFTs, providing a flat 3% to 5% APY increase up to a year. If you choose the 7 month or 10 month staking vault and use an APY boosting NFT, the NFT will be returned at the end of the staking period, and can be used in a new staking vault for the remainder of the utility._

_For example: User adds a 3% APY Boost NFT in a 10 month staking vault. The user would earn 18% APY for 10 months. At the end, he would be returned the 3% APY Boost NFT with 4 months remaining utility._

* _Only one APY booster NFT is allowed per vault. You can create multiple vaults to fit your needs and stake one APY booster NFT on each vault._
{% endhint %}

* _Additionally, staking NFTs with Proton Protocol helps to support the overall network by providing liquidity and supporting transaction processing. This can help to increase the overall value and utility of the platform, which can benefit all users who hold tokens or use the platform's services._
*   _Overall, NFT staking with Proton Protocol is an innovative way to earn rewards and support a decentralized finance platform that is dedicated to providing secure and transparent financial services to users around the world._
